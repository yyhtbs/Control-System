## PNAS 2019: Data-driven discovery of coordinates and governing equations
An interesting paper that uses DNN-Autoencoder to find the intrinsic vector (non-linear dimension rotation) for system identification (SinDy). 
Approach: Joint optimisation.

Idea1: The autoencoder can be realised at the edge while the system identification can be realised at the cloud. 

Idea2: Maybe it can be extended to support multi-agent cases?
